# My React Renders!

This is a page I created to show off my renders made with the React-Three-Fiber and Drei libraries. It is intended to be a showcase of features and designs that can integrate into webpages. This website is not meant to be "finished", but rather continually updated and remade as I continue to progress with 3D modeling and development in my career.

I am a Front-End / React Developer with a specialization in 3D and Graphics. 
These are projects which reflect things I am passionate about, interested in, or maybe I just think it's cool. 
Though most of these renderings are showcases of specific skills, they fit into my larger design perspective. 
In my opinion, 3D graphics are best used sparingly in a website and are best suited as something that draws the user's attention. This site doesn't really do that...
